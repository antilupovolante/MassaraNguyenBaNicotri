\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
This section describes the logical and physical characteristics of each interface 
between the hardware and software componenents of the system.\\
Both educators and students need to have a computer to use the CKB platform.\\
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
This section describes the connections between the system and other specific software components.\\
CodeKataBattle is a web application, so it needs a web browser to be used.\\
\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
This section describes the requirements associated with any communication function required
by this system.\\
All the communications of the eMall infrastructure are made via the HTTP application layer
protocol: obviously, all the devices using the platform must be connected via WiFi or mobile
network (LTE/3G/4G/5G).\\

\subsection{Use Cases Description}
\usecase
{1}
{Login}
{Student, Educator}
{The actor is already registered in the system}
{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The actor requires the Login Page
        \item The system shows the Login Page to the actor
        \item The actor inserts the credentials (email and passwors) in the form
        \item The actor submits the form and sends it to the system
        \item The system processes the information and shows a success message redirecting the user to the homepage
    \end{enumerate}
}
{The actor is correctly logged in and the homepage is displayed}
{
    The provided email or password submitted is wrong
}
{
    In case of exception the system will notify user with a human-readable message
}
\clearpage

\usecase
{2}
{Registration} % name
{Student, Educator, Email Service, GitHub Service} % actor
{The actor browses and opens the webapp} % entry condition
{ % event flow
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The actor clicks the 'Sign up' button 
        \item The actor fills the sign-up form with email and password
        \item The actor submits the form and sends it to the system
        \item The system calls Email Service API to send to the actor an email containing a secret code
        \item The Email Service sends the email to the actor
        \item The actor submits the received verification code
        \item The system displays a success message about the verification of the email
        \item The actor adds his personal information (name, surname, birth date) and submits the form
        \item The student adds his GitHub username and submits the information
        \item The system calls GitHub Service API to check if the username is valid
        \item The GitHub Service sends the response to the system
        \item The system displays a success message about the verification of GitHub username
        \item The system processes the provided information and creates a new account
    \end{enumerate}
}
{The actor signed up correctly} % exit condition
{ % exceptions
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A required registration field is missing when the form is submitted
        \item A provided email is already registered in the system
        \item A wrong verification code is submitted
        \item A wrong GitHub username is submitted
    \end{enumerate}
}
{ % notes
    All the exceptions are treated the same: the system will notify user with a human-readable message and the system asks to retry
}
