\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
This section describes the logical and physical characteristics of each interface 
between the hardware and software componenents of the system.\\
Both educators and students need to have a computer to use the CKB platform.\\
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
This section describes the connections between the system and other specific software components.\\
CodeKataBattle is a web application, so it needs a web browser to be used.\\
\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
This section describes the requirements associated with any communication function required
by this system.\\
All the communications of the eMall infrastructure are made via the HTTP application layer
protocol: obviously, all the devices using the platform must be connected via WiFi or mobile
network (LTE/3G/4G/5G).\\

{Login}
{Student, Educator}
{The actor is already registered in the system.}
{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The actor requires the Login Page.
        \item The system shows the Login Page to the actor.
        \item The actor inserts the credentials (email and passwors) in the form.
        \item The actor submits the form and sends it to the system.
        \item The system processes the information and shows a success message redirecting the user to the homepage.
    \end{enumerate}
}
{The actor is correctly logged in and the homepage is displayed.}
{
    The provided email or password submitted is wrong.
}

        \item The actor clicks the 'Sign up' button.
        \item The actor fills the sign-up form with email and password and submits the form.
        \item The system calls Email Service API to send to the actor an email containing a secret code.
        \item The Email Service sends the email to the actor.
        \item The actor submits the received verification code.
        \item The system displays a success message.
        \item The actor adds his personal information (name, surname, birth date) and submits the form.
        \item The student adds his GitHub username and submits the information.
        \item The system calls GitHub Service API to check if the username is valid.
        \item The GitHub Service sends the response to the system.
        \item The system displays a success message about the verification of GitHub username.
        \item The system processes the provided information and creates a new account.
