\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}
In this section details about user interfaces, 
hardware and application programming interfaces are described.

\subsection{User Interfaces}
In this subsection we present user interfaces for both types of users, educators and students.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
This section describes the logical and physical characteristics of each interface 
between the hardware and software components of the system.\\
Both educators and students need to have a computer to use the CKB platform.
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
This section describes the connections between the system and other specific software components.\\
CodeKataBattle is a web application, so it needs a web browser to be used.
\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
This section describes the requirements associated with any communication function required
by this system.\\
All the communications of the CKB infrastructure are made via the HTTPS application layer
protocol: obviously, all the devices using the platform must be connected via WiFi or mobile
network (LTE/3G/4G/5G).

\subsection{Activity diagrams}
Activity diagrams are used to model the workflow of a process, the operation that are needed to perform a task.
They showcase the sequence and dependencies of various tasks, actions and processes within a system.\\

\textbf{Registration}\\
In the following figure the process of registration for both students and educators is shown. 
The user has to insert his personal information, his email, he has to choose password and specify if he is a student or an educator.\\
If he is a student, he has to link his GitHub account. 
If the email is incorrect, the system repeats the operation. Otherwise, the system
 sends a verification code and checks it.\\If everything goes well, the system creates the new account.

\textbf{Login}\\
In the following figure the process of login for both students and educators is shown. 
The user has to insert his email and the password associated to his account.
\\If the credentials are incorrect, the system repeats the operations. \\Otherwise, the user visualizes the homepage.

\textbf{Tournament evolution}\\
In the following figure the evolution of a tournament is shown. If the user is a student, he can only join
the tournament, choose which battle he wants to attempt and invite friends.\\ If the user is an educator, he
can create a tournament or only create the battles (if he has the permission). He can also evaluate 
the student if the settings of the tournament allow it.

\section{Performance Requirements}
This section presents the performance requirements which need to be fulfilled to make the
whole system as usable as possible.\\
To provide the best user experience, the system must be able to provide a scalable, reactive 
and capable of load-balancing backend, assure protection against DDoS attacks and provide a 
responsive and fluid frontend.\\
The frontend must handle correctly asynchronous interactions with the server, even when the 
connection quality is bad, in order to provide the best possible experience.\\

\section{Design Constraints}

\subsection{Standards compliance}
Specifications described in this document must be respected by the system. Source code of the application
must be commented on and documented adequately. The system should respect the guidelines described
by the GDPR.\\

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
The system requires a computer with a web browser and a stable internet connection.\\

%\subsection{Any other constraint}

\section{Software System Attributes}

\subsection{Reliability}
In order to guarantee better reliability performances, all the scheduled maintenance of the system should
be done during the night. Some functionalities of the system rely on external APIs, though the system should 
not completely fail because of failures in one of those. It is also critical to avoid data loss through 
redundant storage methods.

\subsection{Availability}
The system should offer its functionalities with an availability equal to 99.7\%. This means that, on average, 
the system must be inaccessible for at most one day every year. To achieve this goal, the system should 
provide a high redundancy for the most critical components.

\subsection{Security}
To protect users sensible data the system must collect the minimum data possible, and store them in an
encrypted database. The connection between the application must follows modern standard secure protocols as
HTTPS. Not only passwords should be considered as sensible data, but also users' email addresses and GitHub accounts. 
All passwords must be salted and hashed.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The system should be designed to be easily maintainable. This means that the code should be well documented 
and commented, and the architecture should be modular and well designed.

\subsection{Portability}
The application must run on any OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS) that supports a web browser.
