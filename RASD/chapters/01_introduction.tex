\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
In the last years, more and more students are becoming interested in programming and many educators have realized 
the need of new innovative methods to improve coding skills. \\
CodeKataBattle aims to assist students in enhancing their programming skills by challenging them with creative tasks
 in a competitive and stimulating environment. \\
 \\
 The following document wants to describe the system focusing on the requirements and specifications, providing scenarios 
 and use cases to specify what the system must do and how it should interact with the stakeholders.\\  

 \subsection{Goals}
 In the following table we describe the main goals that our system wants to achieve.\\

    G.1 \label{G.1}& \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}} Allow students to compete in a tournament. \end{tabular}  \\ \hline
    G.2 \label{G.2}& Allow educators to create challenges for students. \\ \hline
    G.3 \label{G.3}& Allow educators to grade students' projects. \\ \hline
    G.4 \label{G.4}& Allow students to collect badges in a tournament proving their skills. \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    }
    \end{table}

    \section{Scope}
The main actors of the system are students and educators. \\
Educators can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Create a tournament:} decide which colleagues can create battles within the tournament and define badges 
    that represent the achievements of individual students; 
    \item \textbf{Create a battle:} set configurations and rules for that battle;
    \item \textbf{Evaluate projects:} manually assign a personal score to the students' works.
\end{itemize}

Students can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Join a tournament};
    \item \textbf{Participate in a battle:} create a team and complete the project with his code;
    \item \textbf{Collect badges: } based on the rules of the tournament and his performance.
\end{itemize}
