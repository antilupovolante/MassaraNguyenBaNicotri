\chapter{Architectural Design}
This section aims to present and analyze the architecture of the S2B in a top-down manner. 
We discuss about the architectural design choices and the reasons behind them. 

\section{Overview: High-level components and their interactions}
The figure shown below represents a high-level description of the components which make up the system.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/component_view/high_level.png}
    \caption{Overview CKB architecture}
    \label{fig:CKB Architecture}
\end{figure}
A web interface will be used to access the platform. 
The overall architecture of the system is based on a three-tier architecture, 
with the application servers interacting with a database management system and
using APIs to retrieve and store data. \\
The three logical layers correspond to three different physical layers and each layer can communicate only with the adjacent ones.
The interactions between clients and server are stateless according to the REST architectural style. \\
The web server is responsible for the communication with the clients and for the management of the requests. \\
The application server holds the business logic of the application and it can communicate with the database server to retrieve and store data, also with the GitHub platform and the Email Service. 

\section{Component view}

\subsection{High level view}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AuthHandler: } it handles the login and registration of the users. It offers the \textbf{AuthCheckInterface} to allow other components to check 
    if a user is authorized. It communicates with the \textbf{MailInterface} to manage confirmation emails and with the \textbf{DataInterface} to check the credentials
    correctness.
    \item \textbf{CKBHandler: } it handles all the functionalities offered by the system. It communicates with the \textbf{DataInterface} to retrieve and store data, with 
    the \textbf{AuthCheckInterface} to check if a user is authorized to perform a certain operation, with the \textbf{MailInterface} to send notifications to the users, and with
    the \textbf{EvaluationInterface} to perform the evaluation of the students' projects.
    It also communicates with the \textbf{GitHubInterface} to retrieve data (nickname and pushed code) from the GitHub platform.
    \item \textbf{MailManager: } it handles the access to the mail server, it provides the \textbf{MailInterface} that allows components to send emails.
    \item \textbf{DataManager: } it handles the access to the persistent data saved on the DB, almost every component communicates with it through the \textbf{DataInterface}.
    \item \textbf{EvaluationTool: } it handles the evaluation of the students' code based on the battle rules. It retrieves this information from the \textbf{CKBHandler}.
    The specific analysis tools are chosen during the implementation phase based on the programming languages that the system will support (e.g., Pylint for Python, CLang for C/C++, ...).

\section{Deployment view}
The figure below shows the architecture of the system. All the users access to the WebApp through the browser, which communicates with
the Web Server. Both Web Server and Application Server are hosted on a Cloud Provider. This choice offers many
advantages, such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Scalability and flexibility: }the ability of adding and removing resources efficiently through 
    the use of load balancing services which allow the application server to manage traffic and workload. 
    \item   \textbf{Security: }the ability to protect the application server using firewall and DMZ, against cyber attacks and possible threats.
    \item   \textbf{Cost efficiency:} the ability to pay only for the resources used which can help to lower the overall cost. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Deployment diagram}
\end{figure}

The deployment diagram offers a more detailed view over the hardware and software components of the system. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{PC: }any device having a browser capable of running the JavaScript code.
    \item   the Cloud Services will host all the business and data logic for the system. It is characterized by 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  \textbf{Firewall:} device used to protect and filter incoming connections to the logic and data layers of the system. It protects the system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
        \item  \textbf{Load Balancer:} service used to distribute the workload across multiple servers. It helps to improve the performance and reliability of the system. It also helps to ensure that application can handle a large volume of requests, without any downtime.
        \item  \textbf{Multiple copies of Web Server and Application Server:} they are used to ensure that the system is always available. The different instances can be created and destroyed dynamically, based on the workload. It also helps to achieve fault tolerance by allowing traffic to be redirect to a different instance, if one instance becomes unavailable.
    \end{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{Database:} used to store all the data of the system. It uses MySQL as DBMS to retrieve and store data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selected architectural styles and patterns}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Three-tier architecture: }the system is based on a three-tier architecture, with every tier (presentation, application and data) 
    having a corresponding layer. The separation of the layers allows to scale the application efficiently by distributing the workload across 
    multiple servers. It also allows to improve the security of the system by protecting the data layer.
    Finally, it improves the maintainability of the system by allowing to modify a single layer without affecting the other ones.
    \item \textbf{REST architectural style: }the system is based on the REST architectural style. REST is a software architectural style that 
    defines a standard language for Web services. It is stateless and it makes easy to integrate with other systems thanks to the uniform 
    interface. It also allows for a clear separation between the client and the server. Clients are not concerned with the internal state of the 
    server, promoting loose coupling and enhancing system maintainability.
